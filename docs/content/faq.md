## How to list available packages?

The package list is available on [Freezer](https://github.com/nyrst/freezer).

Here are few things to make package discovery a nice experience:

- The package list on [nyrst.tools](https://nyrst.tools/apps)
- Run `brrr ls` (or `brrr list`)

## Why this?

I want a simple and quick way to install packages, and [brew](https://brew.sh/) is spending to much time upgrading itself or its package catalog.

## What is this `nyrst` thing?

It all started because of `brew`. I wanted a name like `brew` but different and I chose `brrr`. Like when it is cold.
Then came the package repository, I called it `freezer`.
All this happened on my personal GitHub account, and I decided to move it to an organization.
I spend a lot of time looking for a name around the themes of "cold", "ice", "north" etc.
I came into the word `nyrst` totally randomly.
