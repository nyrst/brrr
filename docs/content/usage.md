Run `brrr` !

:warning:

- You need to have `tar` and `unzip` installed.
- For now, you will have to add `~/.config/brrr/bin` to your PATH.

Next steps: explore the commands, for example:

=> {{ ref("./commands/config.md") }}<br>
=> {{ ref("./commands/list.md") }}<br>
=> {{ ref("./commands/install.md") }}
